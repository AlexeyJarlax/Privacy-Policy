2. Cookies and analytics.

The Mobile App does not use cookies and does not include third-party analytics/tracker tools intended to track user behavior (Firebase Analytics / Google Analytics), and it does not send telemetry to the Right Holder.

3. Security and data storage.

The Mobile App does not store user data on the Right Holder’s servers. All app settings are stored locally on the device.
