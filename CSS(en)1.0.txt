Zero tolerance for CSAE/CSAM
We prohibit any content and behavior related to child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE), including grooming, sexual harassment of minors, sextortion (coercion to obtain intimate materials), attempts to involve minors in sexual activity, and any form of exploitation. We prohibit child sexual abuse material (CSAM) in any form.

How to report (Reporting)
Users can report a violation directly in the app via “Profile → Help → Submit a request”.

Moderation and enforcement
We review reports and may: remove content, restrict features, suspend or ban accounts, and request additional information.
When we receive credible information about CSAM, we take action, including removing content, in accordance with the law and this policy.

Reporting to the appropriate authorities
When CSAM is confirmed, we follow a process to notify the relevant organizations/authorities (NCMEC or the appropriate regional authority, depending on jurisdiction).
