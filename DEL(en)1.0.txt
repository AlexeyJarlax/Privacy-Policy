Pleinair — Deleting Data. Last updated: 19 Dec 2025

How can I delete my account and the data associated with it in our app?

If you would like to delete your account and all data associated with it, you can do so yourself through the app interface by following these steps:

Open the app and sign in to your account (the app collects and stores data only for registered users; data from users who have not registered is not processed).

Go to Settings.

Find and select Delete account.

Confirm the deletion by following the on-screen instructions.

After confirmation, your account and all associated data will be deleted from this app and our database within 48 hours.

What data will be deleted? After your account is deleted, all data related to your activity in the app will be removed (profile, name, in-app avatar, technique descriptions, profile description, geo-tag, settings, statistics).

Re-registration in the app using your current phone number will be blocked for 90 days.

If you have any questions, you can contact support at a9633238@gmail.com
